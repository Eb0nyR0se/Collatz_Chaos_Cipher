🌀 Collatz Chaos Cipher

Welcome to the Collatz Chaos Cipher, a curiosity-driven encryption experiment inspired by the Collatz Conjecture, chaotic systems, signal transformation, and cryptographic exploration blending mathematics, chaos theory, and signal processing. This project implements a reversible block cipher inspired by the famous 3x+1 Collatz function, extended to floating-point arithmetic and integrated with signal spiral dynamics.

Unlike conventional ciphers, this one leverages chaotic iteration and non-linear key transformations to produce unpredictable, avalanche-prone encrypted outputs. Alongside the core algorithm, the repository includes visualization tools to animate bit diffusion and waveform transformations during encryption rounds.

This repository is ideal for cryptographers, mathematicians, chaos enthusiasts, and curious minds interested in experimental encryption techniques — not yet for production use.

The Collatz Chaos Cipher blends number theory with dynamic iteration to produce a reversible block cipher rooted in chaos. Using float-based Collatz logic, signal spirals, and avalanche-prone state mutations, this cipher explores the edge between structured cryptography and creative entropy.
