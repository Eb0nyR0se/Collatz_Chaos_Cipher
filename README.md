# **Collatz Chaos Cipher** ðŸŒ€ 
#

The Collatz Chaos Cipher is an experimental 256-bit block encryption system that fuses elliptic curve cryptography with a novel non-integer extension of the Collatz Conjecture. Inspired by the famous 3x+1 function, this cipher applies chaotic, nonlinear transformations on floating-point data blocks, producing irreversible, high-entropy pathways that exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions and are visually demonstrable.


Unlike traditional ciphers, the Collatz Chaos Cipher leverages chaotic iteration, signal spiral dynamics, and non-linear key influence to generate avalanche-prone encrypted outputs. The project also includes visualization tools to animate bit diffusion, waveform transformations, and entropy changes during encryption rounds, providing insight into the cipherâ€™s complex behavior.
