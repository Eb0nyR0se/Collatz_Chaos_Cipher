# 🌀 Collatz Chaos Cipher

Welcome to the **Collatz Chaos Cipher**, a curiosity-driven encryption experiment inspired by the Collatz Conjecture that explores the blending of mathematics, chaos theory, and signal processing. This project implements a reversible block cipher inspired by the famous 3x+1 Collatz function, extended with signal spiral dynamics.

Unlike conventional ciphers, this one leverages chaotic iteration and non-linear key transformations to produce unpredictable, avalanche-prone encrypted outputs. Alongside the core algorithm, the repository includes visualization tools to animate bit diffusion and waveform transformations during encryption rounds.

This repository is ideal for cryptographers, mathematicians, chaos enthusiasts, and curious minds interested in experimental encryption techniques that are not yet suitable for production use.

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

For educational and experimental purposes only! This is **NOT** secure encryption.  
It’s a toy example demonstrating how a Collatz-inspired iterative function can be used as a pseudorandom transform.

### 🧪 Running Tests

First-time setup (required once):

Make the test script executable by running:

bash

cd path/to/collatz_chaos_cipher
chmod +x run_tests.sh

#After that, you can simply run:

bash
./run_tests.sh

to execute all tests in one step.
#
To verify the correctness of the cipher, automated unit tests are included. Run them from the project root directory using:

bash
python -m unittest test_vectors.py


Or use the provided test runner script:

bash
./run_tests.sh
#
#
Explore the chaos. Encrypt with curves. Challenge convention.
