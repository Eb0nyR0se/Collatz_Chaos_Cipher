This entry details the code enhancements made to the Collatz Chaos Cipher project, focusing on encryption logic, visualization testing, and the addition of interactive features.
#
#
Code Changes and Enhancements:


1. Core Cipher Implementation

   Reinforced the 256-bit encryption scheme, combining elliptic curve cryptography with a non-integer Collatz Conjecture extension.

   Applied chaotic nonlinear transformations to floating-point data blocks, generating high-entropy avalanche-prone outputs.

#
2. Interactive Visualization Features

    Developed real-time visualizers for bit diffusion and waveform transformations during encryption rounds.

    Integrated interactive plots allowing users to explore block value evolution and least significant byte waveforms across rounds with parity-based color coding for deeper insight.

    Added options for visualizing non-integer Collatz-like trajectories, highlighting chaotic decay patterns.

#
3. User Controls and Dynamic Plotting

   Included interactive controls, such as sliders or input parameters, to adjust cipher parameters dynamically during visualization sessions.

   Enabled toggling between different visualization modes, such as block value plots and waveform views, to aid cryptanalysis and educational exploration.
#

4. Testing and Validation

   Implemented comprehensive automated test suites verifying encryption correctness and reversibility.

   Provided runnable scripts run_testssh and unit tests test_vectorspy to streamline validation.
#

5. Code Documentation

   Updated comments and documentation to clearly explain the integration of chaotic functions, elliptic curves, and interactive visualizations.

   Made the codebase more accessible for future contributions and cryptanalysis.
