Journal Entry — Cipher Module Update
#
#
Date: 07/10/2025
Version: v0.3.0
#
#
Summary:
Enhanced the signal_spiral_encrypt algorithm to track bit-level diffusion by recording the least significant byte (LSB) of the internal block state at each encryption round. This additional waveform data supports deeper cryptanalysis and visualization of encryption dynamics.
#
#
Details:

Bit-Level Diffusion Tracking:
Integrated capturing of the block’s LSB per round into the encryption history output. This waveform dataset allows visualization tools to graphically represent how bits evolve and diffuse throughout the encryption rounds, providing insight into the cipher's chaotic behavior on a fine-grained, bitwise level.

Default Key Revision:
Replaced the previous default key (0xDEADBEEFCAFEBABE1234567890ABCDEF) with a new neutral key: 0x4242424242424242. This change removes culturally loaded values and provides a more neutral, consistent baseline for tests and demonstrations.

Backward Compatibility:
Maintained compatibility with existing inputs and outputs. The new waveform data is an additive feature that enriches analysis without disrupting existing workflows.

Implications for Future Work:
The inclusion of waveform data opens paths for advanced visual tools and statistical analyses, potentially improving cipher robustness evaluation and cryptanalysis research.
#
#
Next Steps:

Integrate visualization tools that leverage the waveform data for interactive bit diffusion mapping.

Explore additional entropy and correlation metrics using the detailed waveform history.
